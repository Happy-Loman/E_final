		        		<h2>About Game</h2>
		        		<p>Energy is a small project I started working on part time, while in school. The first version can be played <a href="http://happy-loman.github.io/Energy/">here.</a> It is a semi resource management game with a little bit of flare added. It purely text-based and I plan to keep it that way until much later versions. Your goal in the game is to try to amass as much energy as you can in order to bring your ship back to life. </p>
		        		<div>_____________________________________</div>
		        		<h2>Some Info</h2>

		        		<h3>Console</h3>
		        		<p>Your computer, companion, helper, whatever. Its purpose is to give you information about the condition of the ship</p>

		        		<h3>Player</h3>
		        		<p>That's you! :o</p>

		        		<h3>Manual tab</h3>
		        		<p>Here you can manually create energy with blood and sweat... and your fingers. You cannot upgrade this once you have a few BOTs this creating energy manually is useless. Unless your cell runs low on energy.</p>

		        		<h3>Ship tab</h3>
		        		<p>Here you control many aspects of your ship.
		        			<ul>
		        				<li>Your energy is number 1 in this process, without it you run blind.</li>
		        				<li>Keep your protection up useless now but in the next update it'll be vital. </li>
		        				<li>Weapons, you have over 6 to choose from the cooler the name the stronger it is.</li>
		        				<li>Your space suit, unlock this to have the ability to move around the ship freely without losing much oxygen. The suit draws water from your ship's O2 tank. If the Ship's O2 level is below 10% the suit will stop drawing from it.</li>
		        				<li>Shield: The higher the level the stronger it is.</li>
		        				<li>O2 Level: Water your BOTs find will be turned in to oxygen.</li>
		        				<li>Food: Animals your BOTs find will be turned into food. Not all though, food travelling thorough space may go bad :/.</li>
		        				<li>Time: Tells you what time it is. 1 minute in game is half a second.</li>
		        				<li>Your ship's mass is directly related to the number of parts you have acquired. If you click and hover over this button parts will be ejected out into space. Beware however you need parts for all upgrades.</li>
		        				<li>Consumption: How much energy your ship is eating up, based on the number of BOTs you have and your current weapon and your ship's mass.</li>
		        				<li>Gravity: "The larger the body the more gravity works on it."</li>
		        			</ul>
		        		</p>

		        		<h3>Resources tab</h3>
		        		<p>You have 5 different kinds of resources. Batteries, Wires, Lightbulbs, water and animals. There is a random chance your bot will find any of each kind.</p>

		        		<h3>Engines tab</h3>
		        		<p>3 different engines, Generators, Chargers, heat. These last longer resource.</p>

		        		<h3>Forms of Energy</h3>
		        		<p>Stays forever (because physics) and you can gain an unlimited amounts of energy. Your BOTs have to be really lucky to find these.</p>

		        		<h3>BOTs tab</h3>
		        		<p>Santa's.. Your little helpers. 3 Types, Resource Bots find resources, Engine BOTs find engine resources, and FOE BOTs find FOE resources. You can name them and watch them and nurture them and.. No just, watch them. Let them do their work. </p>

		        		<h3>Upgrades tab</h3>
		        		<p>Up-grade-stuff.</p>
